## Features

2. Click on the [LinkedIn Unfollow After Applying Userscript](userscript.js) to open it.

3. Click the "Raw" button at the top of the script to view its source code.

4. Tampermonkey should recognize the script and open a new tab displaying its details.

5. Click the "Install" button to add the script to your Tampermonkey extension.

6. The script is now installed and active. It will automatically uncheck the "Follow this company" checkbox on LinkedIn job application pages.

## Usage
